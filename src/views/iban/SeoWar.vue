      <p>
        Recently I build
        <a class="text-indigo underline font-bold" href="https://www.ibangen.io/">wwww.ibange.io</a>
        - a small website to generate IBANs.
      </p>

      <em>Why?</em>

      <p>
        Well, to be honest to help me as a Developer, I was not happy with any other solutions and also
        <b class="text-indigo">for fun.</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        While I did want to add more features to it, I did not care about traffic and its popularity, but this weekend out of curiosity I
        did look at the analytics, and this was the result:
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>I was quite happy that people actually checked it out.</p>

      <p>
        But then another curiosity popped into my mind:
        <b>How good does my website rank in Google?</b>
      </p>

      <em>
        <b>‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer:</b>
        I zero knowledge of SEO and how Google ranks websites.
      </em>

      <p>Let's just say I got bored at the 8-10 page of Google and stopped looking üíÄ</p>

      <p>But how's it possible? Half of the other website don't even provide a proper IBAN Generation and half don't work ü§°</p>

      <p>Then I thought of checking some online "ranking" website to see some actual metrics:</p>

      <figure>

      </figure>

      <p>
        And I'm guessing
        <b class="text-indigo">57%</b>
        is not a good score üò≠
      </p>

      <h2>The Plan</h2>

      <p>
        You see, it's not the first time I build something, I release it at that's it. As developers it's quite common to overlook the
        importance of SEO and how it can help you get more traffic and users.
      </p>

      <p>Therefore this time I intend to actually invest some time and learn about SEO and how to improve it.</p>

      <p>
        As I first step, I've integrated Google Analytics to track the website and see how users interact with it. Next, I'll implementing
        the suggestion the free SEO tool gave me and see how that goes.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'll keep writing about the progress and see how it goes üîú
