      <em>
        About three years ago, I learned about the Japanese concept of
        <b>IKIGAI</b>
        üáØüáµ
      </em>

      <p>
        It was quite random actually. My colleague and manager at the time,
        <a class="text-indigo" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mihaituhari/">@MihaiTuhari,</a>
        was sharing his screen, and in his bookmarks, I noticed one named
        <em>Ikigai.</em>
        I believe that to this day, he still has that bookmark üëÄ
      </p>
      <p>I was quite intrigued, so I looked it up. It's a very simple concept:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Ikigai (Áîü„ÅçÁî≤Êñê, 'a reason for being') is a Japanese concept referring to something that
          gives a person a sense of purpose, a reason for living.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

        />

      <p>
        Truth be told, even though the idea has been in my mind for the past three years, it never
        became a main focus. It was there, but I didn't really act on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast forward to today, I mentioned in my
        <a class="text-indigo" href="/posts/fire-1">first FIRE post</a>
        that I was looking to define some goals and set a path for myself, to assist in defining my
        FIRE goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        So there I was, it's Sunday morning and I was about to start yet another SCI-FI book üõ∏, but
        instead, I decided to read something about Ikigai üìö
      </p>
      <p>
        I started reading
        <a
          class="text-indigo"
          href="https://www.amazon.com/Ikigai-Japanese-Secret-Long-Happy/dp/0143130722"
        >
          Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life
        </a>
        <i>by H√©ctor Garc√≠a and Francesc Miralles.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        I was quite hooked by it. I haven't finished yet, but I wanted to share some thoughts about
        the first half of the book.
      </p>
      <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è A side note - about self-improvement books</h2>
      <p>
        I know self-improvement books have started getting a bad reputation in recent years. I'm not
        sure what to say. I do agree that 90% of the information in these books is repeated over and
        over. But at the same time, I cannot deny that I've learned a lot from them.
      </p>
      <p>
        People say:
        <em>"I've heard about idea X over 99 times in different books."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        And then I reply, well, why then are you still not integrating that concept/idea into your
        life?
      </p>
      <p>
        And of course, I'm being harsh. My point is, sometimes it can be good to see new
        perspectives on the same idea.
      </p>

      <h2>
        <em>Flow</em>
      </h2>

      <p>
        In the first part of the book, a key concept is
        <i class="text-indigo">flow.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        In a nutshell ü•ú,
        <i>flow</i>
        is a state of mind where you're so focused on a task that you lose track of time.
      </p>
      <p>Or as the book puts it:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          What makes us enjoy doing something so much that we forget about whatever worries we might
          have while we do it? When are we happiest?
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I'm pretty sure everyone has experienced it before, and it's nothing new.</p>
      <p>
        The idea is that analyzing what puts us in a flow state can help us discover our Ikigai.
      </p>
      <p>The book gives examples of different people and how they thrived doing what they loved.</p>
      <p>
        One example I enjoyed was
        <em>The purity of Ghibli.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="text-indigo">Hayao Miyazaki,</span>
        the director of the animated films produced by
        <span class="text-indigo">Studio Ghibli,</span>
        was so passionate about his work that he spent many Sundays in the studio, enjoying the
        state of flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2013, he announced his retirement, but the day after his "retirement," he went to Studio
        Ghibli and sat down to draw.
      </p>
      <p>
        He wouldn't make any more films, but he would continue drawing until the end of his days.
      </p>

      <em>P.S. If you haven't yet - please do watch Studio Ghibli films üôè</em>

      <h2>What does it mean to retire then?</h2>
      <p>
        It's ironic that the key idea of FIRE is to
        <em>retire early,</em>
        yet the concept of ikigai suggests that as long as you do what you love, you actually
        <b class="text-indigo">never retire.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, I think the key difference here is that FIRE actually focuses on financial retirement.
        It doesn't mean that once one achieves FIRE status, they're going to move to an island and
        drink martinis all day long üç∏
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe FIRE actually gives one the space and time to explore what their Ikigai is,
        without the pressure of having to work for a living.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideally, one could do both at the same time: doing what they love and earning a living from
        it.
      </p>
      <p><b>But let's be honest, it's not that easy.</b></p>
      <p>I enjoy coding, but do I see myself writing code at 70?</p>
      <p>
        Probably yes, but in a form that I enjoy. For instance, I've always wanted to build my own
        roguelike video game, but it's not something I can do right now.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, to be honest,
        <b>I am quite confused,</b>
        and I'm still figuring out my ikigai.
      </p>
      <p>
        But one thing I'm sure of is that I really enjoy writing these blog posts, and I'm üíØ sure I
        always end up in a
        <em>flow</em>
        state when writing.
