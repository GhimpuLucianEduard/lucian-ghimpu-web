        So here we are in the final third of the amazing book:
        <a class="text-indigo italic" href="https://amzn.to/3TSKf0g">
          "The Psychology of Money: Timeless Lessons on Wealth, Greed, and Happiness"
        </a>
        by the author,
        <em>Morgan Housel.</em>
        I've already reviewed the first two-thirds of the book, which you can find here:

      </ol>
      <p>
        We now delve into the last
        <b>six</b>
        chapters and some concluding thoughts, so let's dive in üìñ
      </p>
      <h2>13. Room For Error</h2>
      <p>
        This chapter is somewhat linked to the previous ones and primarily highlights the idea that
        you must always be prepared for adverse outcomes and have a contingency plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Essentially, having
        <b>room for error</b>
        improves one's
        <b>endurance,</b>
        which in turn provides more
        <i>time in the market.</i>
        More time in the market equates to more opportunities to
        <b class="text-indigo">compound</b>
        your money.
      </p>

      <p>See how everything is interconnected?</p>
      <blockquote>
        "The person with enough room for error in part of their strategy (cash) to let them endure
        hardship in another (stocks) has an edge over the person who gets wiped out, game over,
        insert more tokens, when they're wrong."
      </blockquote>

      <h2>14. You'll Change</h2>
      <p>
        We saw that to succeed, you must have a plan and
        <b>stick to it.</b>
        As discussed in previous chapters, long-term plans, for both good and bad times, are crucial
        for one's success.
      </p>

      <p>Now, think about your current self and how you might be in 30 years.</p>
      <em>Do you think you will still have the same goals? üëÄ</em>

      <p>
        Personally, I have my doubts, but I would still feel more comfortable having and respecting
        a plan.
      </p>

      <p>
        The essence of this chapter is to highlight that
        <b class="text-indigo">we change</b>
        and it's okay to adapt our plans. However, it's not wise to remain anchored to past plans if
        they no longer align with your current needs.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "Embracing the idea that financial goals set when you were a different person should be
        abandoned without mercy versus being kept on life support and dragged on can be an effective
        strategy to minimize future regret."
      </blockquote>

      <h2>15. Nothing's Free</h2>

      <blockquote>"Every job looks easy when you're not the one doing it."</blockquote>

      <p>
        As we go through life, we inevitably come to the conclusion that nothing is free. But have
        you ever considered the price of the stock market? I'm not talking about
        <b>individual stocks,</b>
        but rather the popular, low-cost
        <b>index funds</b>
        that many of us favor.
      </p>

      <em>Is there a hidden cost behind that average annual return of 8-10%?</em>

      <blockquote>
        "It's volatility, fear, doubt, uncertainty, and regret‚Äîall of which are easy to overlook
        until you're experiencing them in real time."
      </blockquote>

      <p>The author proceeds with an illustrative example:</p>

      <p>Imagine you want a new car and it costs $30,000. You have three options:</p>

      <ol>
        <li class="text-green-500">Pay the $30,000</li>
        <li class="text-amber-500">Find a cheaper, used one</li>
        <li class="text-red-500">Steal it</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        99% of people would avoid the third option. Yet, in investing, many people choose a similar
        path. They look for
        <b>"tricks"</b>
        to bypass market volatility and seek quick riches. They think they can sell before the next
        recession and buy back when the market is low, not realizing that volatility is
        <b>constant.</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        The author highlights this using the example of
        <b>Netflix</b>
        stock. Netflix's stock returned over
        <b class="text-green-500">35,000%</b>
        from 2002 to 2018, but it traded below its previous all-time high on
        <b class="text-red-500">94%</b>
        of days.
      </p>

      <p>There's no shortcut; enduring volatility is the price you pay in this scenario.</p>

      <blockquote>
        "Market returns are never free and never will be. They demand you pay a price, just like any
        other product."
      </blockquote>

      <h2>16. You And Me</h2>

      <blockquote>
        "Investors often innocently take cues from other investors who are playing a different game
        than they are."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        In this chapter, the author looks at the concept of a
        <a class="text-indigo" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bubble.asp">bubble.</a>
        While he acknowledges the complexity of understanding bubbles, the point here is that a key
        factor in their creation is when
        <em>
          "long-term investors playing one game start taking their cues from short-term traders
          playing a different one."
        </em>
      </p>

      <p>
        A stock valued at
        <b>$60</b>
        by a long-term investor might be disregarded by a short-term trader.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "An important takeaway is that few things matter more with money than understanding your own
        time horizon and not being swayed by the actions and behaviors of people playing different
        games than you are."
      </blockquote>

      <h2>17. The Seduction of Pessimism</h2>

      <blockquote>
        "Real optimists don't believe that everything will be great. That's complacency."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This chapter was probably my favorite. It explores the notion that people tend to admire
        those with a pessimistic view of the world and the future more than the hopeful ones.
      </p>

      <p>
        The author illustrates with the story fo the
        <a class="text-indigo" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers">
          Wright Brothers (Orville and Wilbur),
        </a>
        who invented the airplane. For a long time, people considered them crazy. Their efforts
        passed largely unnoticed, and they were mocked by the press. At one point, the
        <b>The Washington Post</b>
        opined:
        <em>
          ‚ÄúThere will never be such a thing as commercial aerial freighters. Freight will continue
          to be transported across the patient earth.‚Äù
        </em>
      </p>

      <p>The first cargo plane took off just five months later.</p>

      <p>
        In finance, pessimism often is even stronger because, if the economy fails, it typically
        impacts everyone. If Orville and Wilbur had been wrong, it's unlikely many of us would have
        been affected.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "Progress happens too slowly to notice, but setbacks happen too quickly to ignore."
      </blockquote>

      Here's the improved version of your blog post, with corrections and slight enhancements for
      better flow and clarity:

      <h2>18. When You'll Believe Anything</h2>

      <p>
        Imagine an alien in
        <b>2007</b>
        üëΩ tasked with assessing the economic health of the planet.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is before the
        <b>housing crisis</b>
        and the following
        <b>recession.</b>
        At that time, the alien would have likely concluded that the economy was thriving.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fast forward to
        <b>2009,</b>
        and the alien returns. Observing our factories, he notices they are still producing at the
        same, if not higher, rates. People are still living at the somewhat same standard yet with
        better technologies. Smartphones just got popular üòé The economy seems to be functioning.
      </p>

      <p>
        The alien would probably conclude again that the
        <b>economy is doing well.</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        However, upon looking at the financial data,
        <b>on paper,</b>
        it becomes apparent that trillions of dollars in value were lost. How could this be?
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "Other than shifting to a new narrative, we had the same, if not greater, capacity for
        wealth and growth in 2009 as we did in 2007. Yet the economy took its worst hit in 80 years.
        This differs from, say, Germany in 1945, whose manufacturing base was decimated, or Japan in
        the 2000s, facing a shrinking working-age population. Those were instances of tangible
        economic damage."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        In essence ü•ú, we lost faith in the housing market and its previously believed
        <b>never-ending growth.&nbsp;</b>
        <b class="text-indigo">We simply stopped believing in a story.</b>
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusions ‚úçÔ∏è</h2>

      <p>There are actually two more chapters in the book:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>19. All Together Now</li>
        <li>20. Confessions</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The first acts as a summary of all the lessons learned. However, since I'm already providing
        a summary here, I thought to skip reporting it here.
      </p>

      <p>
        The last chapter is quite intriguing,
        <b>where the author</b>
        shares insights on his personal finances and investment strategy, including how his family
        manages their finances.
      </p>

      <p>
        One interesting point is that the author purchased his home with cash, and decided not to
        take
        <b>a mortgage</b>
        despite the low-interest rates.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "Our goal isn't to be coldly rational; just psychologically reasonable. The sense of
        independence I feel from owning our house outright far outweighs the potential financial
        gain from leveraging our assets with a cheap mortgage. The elimination of a monthly payment
        feels better than maximizing the long-term value of our assets. It grants a sense of
        independence."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        I deeply resonate with this mindset, and I believe it encapsulates the core message of the
        book. It's all about finding what works for you; it's personal, and it's fundamentally about
        psychology.
