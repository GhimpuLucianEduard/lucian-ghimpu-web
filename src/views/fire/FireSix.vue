      <p>I picked up a new book over the weekend, and surprisingly, I got hooked on it!</p>
      <p>
        The book is
        <a class="text-indigo italic" href="https://amzn.to/3TSKf0g">
          "The Psychology of Money: Timeless Lessons on Wealth, Greed, and Happiness"
        </a>
        &nbsp; by
        <em>Morgan Housel.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Honestly, I usually have a hard time getting into books about investments or economics. But
        to my surprise, this one really captivated me üëÄ
      </p>
      <p>
        So far, I've read about
        <span class="text-indigo">~33%</span>
        of the book and I've thoroughly enjoyed the writing style and the stories.
      </p>
      <em>So, what's the book about?</em>
      <p>Well, the title is quite clear. But to summarize in the author's words:</p>
      <blockquote>
        "Financial success is not a hard science. It's a soft skill, where how you behave is more
        important than what you know."
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Through a series of short stories, the author expands on this concept. I've decided to write
        a series of posts related to the book as I progress through it. I'll aim to keep them short
        and focused.
      </p>
      <h2>Intro: It's Not Just About Spreadsheets</h2>
      <p>Do you recognize the guy below?</p>
      <p>
        If not, I highly recommend watching
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoYC_8cutb0">this scene</a>
        from the movie
        <em>"The Big Short."</em>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dkcw58wif/image/upload/v1704834324/lucianghimpu.com/fire-6/my-quant.jpg"
          alt="Quant Guy"
        />

      <p>
        Jokes aside, one common perception people have about financial success is that it's
        intrinsically linked to numbers, spreadsheets, complex math, formulas, rules, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Finance</b>
        per se definitely involves all of the above, but the author argues that
        <b>financial success</b>
        is not a hard science. It's a
        <b class="text-indigo">soft skill,</b>
        where how you behave is more important than what you know.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "Spreadsheets can model the historical frequency of big stock market declines. But they
        can't model the feeling of coming home, looking at your kids, and wondering if you've made a
        mistake."
      </blockquote>
      <p>Essentially, at the end of the day, we are still humans, driven by emotions.</p>

      <h2>1. No One's Crazy</h2>
      <p>
        The first chapter delves into the notion that everyone has a unique perspective on finances,
        shaped by their individual experiences. And that's perfectly normal.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A person who grew up in poverty views
          <b class="text-indigo">risk and reward</b>
          differently than the child of a wealthy banker ever could
        </li>
        <li>
          Those who experienced high inflation firsthand have a completely different worldview
          compared to someone accustomed to stable prices
        </li>
        <li>
          Someone who has lived through multiple stock market crashes will behave differently than
          someone who has just experienced their first
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Essentially, it all depends on factors like the era you were born in, your country, and your
        social status.
      </p>
      <p>
        The book cites an example where most lottery tickets üéüÔ∏è are actually bought by the
        lowest-income households, who spend an average of
        <b class="text-indigo">$400</b>
        per year on them.
      </p>
      <p>This is the same demographic where having a $400 emergency fund is a rarity.</p>
      <p>It might sound crazy, right?</p>
      <em>
        But remember, we are not
        <b>the lowest-income households.</b>
        We cannot fully grasp their reality.
      </em>
      <blockquote>
        The economists wrote: ‚ÄúOur findings suggest that individual investors' willingness to bear
        risk depends on personal history.‚Äù
        <b>
          Not intelligence, or education, or sophistication. Just the dumb luck of when and where
          you were born.
        </b>
        [...] Dogs were domesticated 10,000 years ago and still retain some behaviors of their wild
        ancestors. Yet here we are, with between 20 and 50 years of experience in the modern
        financial system, hoping to be perfectly acclimated.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>2. Luck & Risk üçÄ</h2>

      <p>
        I was particularly captivated by the story in this chapter, essentially revolves around
        <b class="text-indigo">Bill Gates.</b>
        More precisely, it highlights how he attended one of the very few schools in the world that
        had a computer at that time.
      </p>

      <p>Here's a brief breakdown:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In 1968 there were roughly
          <b>303 million</b>
          high-school-age people in the world, according to the UN -
          <b class="text-lime-500">8.57%</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          About
          <b>18 million</b>
          of them lived in the United States -
          <b class="text-yellow-500">0.51%</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          About
          <b>270,000</b>
          of them lived in Washington state -
          <b class="text-amber-500">0.0076%</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          A little over
          <b>100,000</b>
          of them lived in the Seattle area -
          <b class="text-orange-500">0.0028%</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          And only about
          <b>300</b>
          of them attended Lakeside School -
          <b class="text-red-500">0.0000085%</b>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>‚ÄúIf there had been no Lakeside, there would have been no Microsoft‚Äù</blockquote>
      <em>Gates said to told the school's graduating class in 2005.</em>

      <p>
        It's commonly known that luck plays a significant role in financial success. However, the
        problem often lies in our tendency to focus only on
        <b class="text-indigo">extreme cases</b>
        as examples, which typically garner a lot of media attention.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "There are more relevant lessons to take away from broad observation than there are in
        studying the extreme characters that tend to dominate the news"
      </blockquote>

      <h2>3. Never Enough</h2>

      <blockquote>
        "Modern capitalism is a pro at two things: generating wealth and generating envy"
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Another intriguing concept the author examines is the difficulty people face in recognizing
        when to stop chasing more wealth. This is often referred to as
        <a
          class="text-indigo"
          href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exitstrategy.asp#:~:text=An%20exit%20strategy%20is%20a,have%20been%20met%20or%20exceeded."
        >
          "having an exit strategy".
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The author goes beyond this, addressing the overarching
        <b>greed</b>
        that can take over individuals.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "A rookie baseball player who earns $500,000 a year. He is, by any definition, rich. But say
        he plays on the same team as Mike Trout, who has a 12-year, $430 million contract. By
        comparison, the rookie is broke [...] The point is that the ceiling of social comparison is
        so high that virtually no one will ever hit it. Which means it's a battle that can never be
        won, or that the only way to win"
      </blockquote>

      <h2>4. Confounding Compounding</h2>

      <p>The best way to describe this chapter is again with a short numerical breakdown:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Buffett</b>
          began serious investing when he was
          <b>10 years old</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          By the time he was
          <b>30</b>
          he had a net worth of
          <b>$1 million,</b>
          or $9.3 million adjusted for inflation
        </li>
        <li>
          At the time the book was written, Warren Buffett's net worth is
          <b>$84.5 billion.</b>
          Of that,
          <b>$84.2 billion</b>
          was accumulated after his 50th birthday
        </li>
      </ul>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dkcw58wif/image/upload/v1704902866/lucianghimpu.com/fire-6/buffet.webp"
          alt="Buffet Net Worth Evolution"
        />
        <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <blockquote>
        What if he was a more normal person, spending his teens and 20s exploring the world and
        finding his passion, and by age 30 his net worth was, say, $25,000? And let's say he still
        went on to earn the extraordinary annual investment returns he's been able to generate (22%
        annually), but quit investing and retired at age 60 to play golf and spend time with his
        grandkids. What would a rough estimate of his net worth be today? Not $84.5 billion. $11.9
        million. 99.9% less than his actual net worth.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Now, maybe Buffet example is a little bit extreme, but the main idea is still the same:
        <b>his skill is investing, but his secret is time.</b>
        And that's something we all have.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Getting Wealthy vs. Staying Wealthy</h2>

      <blockquote>
        "If I had to summarize money success in a single word it would be ‚Äúsurvival.‚Äù
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        <b>Getting money and keeping money are two different skills.</b>
        This is the main idea behind this chapter. I actually explore a similar idea in
        <a class="text-indigo" href="/posts/fire-1">in my first blog post</a>
        about FIRE üëÄ
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Getting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and putting yourself out there. But
        keeping money requires the opposite of taking risk. It requires humility, and fear that what
        you've made can be taken away from you just as fast. It requires frugality and an acceptance
        that at least some of what you've made is attributable to luck, so past success can't be
        relied upon to repeat indefinitely.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Essentially, the same bold investor who takes significant risks must also practice
        frugality. Ironically, most of the time I observe the opposite behavior among people.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I mean is that during
        <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp">bull markets,</a>
        I see people acting as if they are invincible, taking huge risks, and spending liberally.
        Then, during
        <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp">bear markets,</a>
        they become overly cautious, hesitant to invest, and fearful of spending.
      </p>

      <p>
        As clich√© as it sounds, it's often wise to question the actions of the majority - sometimes,
        the right approach might just be the opposite of what most people are doing.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "Planning is important, but the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not
        going according to plan"
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        And that's it for now üëÄ I'll give you more insight as soon as possible. I hope that maybe I
        got you hooked, the book is definitely worth a read!
