      <p>Have you started investing yet? 🫡</p>

      <p>
        In the
        <a class="text-indigo" href="posts/fire-1">last post,</a>
        I told you the story of Romania in the early 2000s and how it shaped my FIRE view today.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, with this post, I'm heading in a different direction, exploring the current events and
        situations in Romania.
      </p>

      <p>
        In particular, a
        <a class="text-indigo" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7J2T3wJJSI">mockumentary</a>
        that was released recently.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a nutshell 🥜, it's a mockery of some Romanian Tai Lopez wannabes. They've appeared in
        recent years in Romania, trying to sell the dream of becoming rich.
      </p>

      <p>
        As mentioned in the video, they are classic cases of
        <b class="text-indigo">snake oil</b>
        sellers.
      </p>

      <p>
        I definitely enjoyed the video and wanted to share some thoughts on it and the
        above-mentioned topic.
      </p>

      <em>Okay Lucian, but why should we care about your opinion?</em>

      <p>Well, mainly for two 2️⃣ reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I consider myself to have a balanced view on the matter</li>
        <li>I love internet drama 🍿</li>
      </ul>

      <h2></h2>

      <p>I think the documentary is a great piece of content. It's well-made and captivating.</p>

      <p>
        Overall, I can extract some
        <span class="text-green-500">positives</span>
        and
        <span class="text-red-500">negatives</span>
      </p>

      <p>But if you want to read more, I'll expand on specific topics.</p>

      <p>Let's see:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="text-green-500">Success is not measured in money</li>
        <li class="text-green-500">
          Modern snake oil sellers do exist, and they negatively affect society
        </li>
        <li class="text-green-500">
          There is no
          <b class="text-green-500">get-rich-quick formula</b>
          (and definitely not via a $29 course)
        </li>
        <li class="text-red-500">There's some mockery related to AI, investments, and crypto</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🟢 The good - success, money and hard work</h2>

      <p>
        I know the positive ideas seem kind of obvious, but I still remember back in
        <b>~2015,</b>
        I think, when I first saw the infamous
        <b>Tai Lopez garage ad.</b>
        Naturally, I was intrigued 💀
      </p>

      <figure>

          alt="Tai Lopez Image"
        />
        <figcaption>The infamous Tai Lopoz Garage scene</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>I was 18 at the time, a bit confused, but luckily, I didn't buy any online courses.</p>
      <p>Still, I'm pretty sure it planted a seed of frustration in me.</p>
      <em><b>I wanted more.</b></em>

      <p>
        Over the years, thanks to both my father and life experiences, I learned to control that
        feeling. I learned to be grateful for what I have and to be patient.
      </p>

      <p>📚 If I could summarize my view nowadays in two short ideas, they would be:</p>

      <b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="text-indigo">Success</span>
            is not measured in money. It's measured in happiness and freedom. Money is just a tool
            to achieve that. It's not the end goal.
          </li>
          <li>
            To achieve this, you need to provide value to others. Learn a skill and master it. That
            usually involves
            <span class="text-indigo">hard work and dedication.</span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </b>

      <em>
        I know these sound cliché, but still, I hope that at least
        <b>my little brother (16)</b>
        and
        <b>my little sister (15)</b>
        will read this and take it to heart, or at least consider it.
      </em>

      <h2>🔴 The Somewhat Bad - The Stigma Around Investing</h2>

      <p>Now, let's get to the juicy part.</p>
      <p>
        First, let's acknowledge that modern snake oil sellers have been using investing, crypto,
        AI, and similar
        <span class="text-indigo">buzzwords</span>
        to sell their courses.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, understandably, a sort of stigma has been built around these concepts. I can't even
        remember all the crypto scams that have been exposed in recent years.
      </p>

      <p>So, let's address the three main concepts:</p>

      <h3>📉 Investing - Stonks 💎 🤲</h3>

      <p>
        Traditionally, when talking about investing, people think of the
        <b>stock market,</b>
        a central piece of Capitalism.
      </p>

      <p>
        And
        <span class="text-indigo">Capitalism</span>
        is the keyword here.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think most people who have a negative view of investing and the stock market usually feel
        strongly against Capitalism. I'm not an expert, so I won't debate Capitalism as a system.
        But in any economic system, I think people will have the urge to invest and plan for the
        future.
      </p>

      <p>So, hear me out about investing.</p>

      <p>It's pretty clear that just holding your money in a bank account isn't a good idea.</p>

      <p>
        Also, usually, especially in your early 20s-30s, you don't have a large amount of money to
        invest in real estate. You would have to take a loan, and that's a whole other topic.
      </p>

      <em>So, what am I supposed to do with my money?</em>

      <p>
        First things first,
        <span class="text-indigo">invest in yourself and your skills,</span>
        but let's say I'm doing that and I still have some money left.
      </p>

      <p>
        The stock market offers different solutions for that. It's not like
        <span class="text-indigo">"The Wolf of Wall Street."</span>
        There are some low-risk ways to invest in the stock market (like ETFs).
      </p>

      <p>
        Granted, they are not going to make you rich overnight, but it's all about time and
        <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp" class="text-indigo">
          compound interest.
        </a>
      </p>

      <p>
        There's a lot to discuss on this topic, and be sure that I'll write more, but if I could sum
        it up:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Investing and the stock market is
          <b>not just about trading</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          There are different financial instruments with varying levels of risk and expected returns
        </li>
        <li>Take advantage of them early</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>🤖 About AI - why not?</h3>

      <p>
        I'm not going to spend too much words on this topic, again I think the negative view that
        has been buinding around AI is due to the recent
        <span class="text-indigo">success of ChatGPT</span>
        and the way it's being used by people to make some quick money.
      </p>

      <em>
        For instance: how most companies have been pushing for AI-driven features to raise money or
        how some people have been using AI to generate low effort content.
      </em>

      <p>All I can share is my personal experience as a 🧑🏻‍💻 Software Engineer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I've been using
          <a class="text-indigo" href="https://github.com/features/copilot">Copilot</a>
          for a while now, and its 💯 improving my productivity
        </li>
        <li>I've been using OpenAI tools on a daily basis for different aspects of my life</li>
        <li>I do use some of the AI feature that have been pushed in most apps recently</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>🪙 Crypto - The Black Sheep 🐑</h3>

      <p>And now we get to the juiciest part 🤡</p>

      <p>First, let me clarify a few things:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          15% of my net worth
          <b>is in crypto</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          I have an all-time profit of
          <span class="text-green-500">+17%</span>
        </li>
        <li>I agree that 95% of the crypto world is scammy and shady</li>
        <li>I believe some aspects of it can have a real positive impact on the world</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As a side note, when I say
        <b>crypto,</b>
        I also include
        <b>blockchain</b>
        as a piece of technology. So, I'm not just talking about the financial aspect.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have some strong beliefs related to this topic that I'll probably avoid discussing for
        now. Putting my beliefs aside, I usually tell people the following idea:
      </p>

      <p>
        The way you should look at blockchain/crypto is the same way you should approach any new
        emerging idea or technology. Imagine being there when the internet was first introduced.
      </p>

      <p>
        Could you have imagined
        <span class="text-indigo">its potential?</span>
        Could you have imagined the impact it would have on the world?
      </p>

      <em>Me? Probably not - but I would be intrigued.</em>

      <p>
        Would you bet on it
        <i>(invest in it)</i>
        ?
      </p>

      <em>Me? Hell yes.</em>
      🫡

      <p>
        As a human, how can you not be intrigued by new ideas and technology? Think even further
        back, to when it was proposed that Earth is not flat and not the center of the universe.
        Wouldn't you have been intrigued by that?
      </p>

      <p>Yes, it might not turn out to be a success, but aren't mistakes also a part of life?</p>

      <p>
        So, all I'm saying is that I'm intrigued and I'm willing to invest a
        <span class="text-indigo">small percentage</span>
        of my net worth in it.
      </p>

      <h2>📜 Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        Be balanced, don't believe all the finance gurus online, but also don't dismiss the positive
        value investing could have in your life.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general,
        <span class="text-indigo">don't be an extremist,</span>
        either on the left or right of the spectrum. Look for the good in both sides.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's it! I'll probably explore more each concept when publishing my finances and history
        with them. But for now, I hope you enjoyed this 🙏
