        In my previous post, I reviewed some of the concepts presented in
        <a class="text-indigo italic" href="https://amzn.to/3TSKf0g">
          "The Psychology of Money: Timeless Lessons on Wealth, Greed, and Happiness"
        </a>
        &nbsp; by the author,
        <em>Morgan Housel.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, we're picking up where we left off, exploring the next segment of the book. We will
        take us have a look at themes such as freedom, saving, surprises, and much more üëÄ
      </p>

      <p>
        However, as I mentioned in my last post, I highly recommend reading the book itself. It
        presents these concepts into compelling stories that, in my opinion, resonate more deeply
        than I could convey üìö
      </p>

      <h2>6. Tails, You Win ü™ô</h2>

      <p>
        As someone with an affinity for mathematics üî¢, I find it more easy to begin with specific
        numerical examples before delving deeper into a concept.
      </p>

      <p>
        Picture yourself as a
        <a
          class="text-indigo"
          href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/venturecapitalist.asp#:~:text=A%20venture%20capitalist%20(VC)%20is,access%20to%20the%20equities%20markets."
        >
          Venture Capitalist during the period of 2004-2014.
        </a>
      </p>

      <p>Out of more than 21,000 ventures:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="text-red-500">65%</span>
          experienced losses
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="text-amber-500">2.5%</span>
          achieved returns of
          <b>10x-20x</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="text-yellow-500">1%</span>
          achieved returns of
          <b>20x</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="text-green-500">0.5%</span>
          achieved returns of
          <b>50x</b>
          or more
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Astonishingly, that last category represents just 100 out of 21,000 ventures, yet it
        accounts for the majority of the industry's returns.
      </p>

      <em>Lucian, this sounds like gambling. What's the point?</em>

      <p>
        The point is that you can be wrong numerous times, but those rare moments when you are
        right,
        <b>you win big.</b>
        It may not seem intuitive, but it's true.
      </p>

      <p>
        To achieve a substantial victory, however, you must actively participate. You have to keep
        trying, most likely for years, but perseverance is key.
      </p>

        "If you think that's a significant failure, we're currently working on much larger failures.
        I'm not kidding. Some of them will make the Fire Phone appear insignificant." - CEO Jeff
        Bezos
      </blockquote>

      <h2>7. Freedom üí∏</h2>

      <blockquote>
        "More than your salary. More than the size of your house. More than the prestige of your
        job. Having control over doing what you want, when you want, with the people you want to, is
        the most comprehensive factor contributing to happiness." - Unknown
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        There seems to be a pervasive illusion of freedom in our world. In my case, and as the book
        also highlights, the idea that we carry our work home with us. We find ourselves constantly
        preoccupied with it, especially if we're engaged in mentally demanding job.
      </p>

      <p>I want to be able to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spend more time practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu ü•ã</li>
        <li>Read more books üìö</li>
        <li>Create a video game üéÆ</li>
        <li>Devote time to personal projects üë®üèº‚Äçüíª</li>
        <li>Most importantly, spend quality time with those I hold dear</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        However,
        <span class="text-indigo">it's challenging.</span>
        You must strike a balance between these dreams and your job and other responsibilities. I
        believe it's achievable, and everyone should strive for some form of financial freedom.
      </p>

        "Your children don't desire your wealth (or what your wealth buys) as much as they desire
        you. Specifically, they desire your presence." - Unknown
      </blockquote>

      <h2>8: Man in the Car Paradox üöó</h2>

      <p>This brief chapter can be summed up and explained through a single quote:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "When you see someone driving a nice car, you rarely think, 'Wow, the guy driving that car
        is cool.' Instead, you think, 'Wow, if I had that car, people would think I'm cool.'"
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Essentially, the idea is that we tend to overestimate the impact of material possessions,
        believing they give a certain status upon us.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "Humility, kindness, and empathy will bring you more respect than horsepower ever will."
      </blockquote>

      <h2>9. Wealth is What You Don't See üí∞</h2>

      <p>
        Now, this chapter is follow-up to the previous one. Let's return to the car example. You
        spot someone driving a
        <b>$100,000</b>
        car, and you assume they must be wealthy.
      </p>

      <em>But what else do you know about that person? Do you have another data point?</em>

      <blockquote>
        "Wealth is the nice cars not purchased. The diamonds not bought. The watches not worn, the
        clothes forgone, and the first-class upgrade declined. Wealth is financial assets that
        haven't yet been converted into the stuff you see."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The book provides an excellent analogy, comparing
        <b class="text-green-500">wealth</b>
        to
        <b class="text-blue-500">health.</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's say you engage in a workout and burn 500 calories. You don't reward yourself with a
        cake afterward, do you?
      </p>

      <p>
        Similarly, wealth is about self-control and having a better
        <b>time preference,</b>
        which is the ability to delay gratification.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Save Money üíµ</h2>

      <blockquote>
        "Building wealth has little to do with your income or investment returns, and lots to do
        with your savings rate."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This is a
        <b>intriguing</b>
        chapter, so buckle up. We'll begin with a short story. Back in the '70s, it was estimated
        that we would run out of oil within a decade.
      </p>

      <em>Did we run out of oil? üõ¢Ô∏è</em>

      <p>
        No, we didn't. Instead, we became more efficient in its usage. Factories and cars became
        more energy-efficient.
      </p>

        />

      </figure>

      <p>
        The same principle applies to money. Consider the classic example of a 10% annual return.
        It's considered a good return, but achieving it requires considerable effort and investment.
        Billions of dollars are spent to increase the return by just 1%.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, think about how much effort it would take for you to save 10%. The effort is
        <b class="text-green-500">significantly smaller.</b>
        Don't want to invest? Think the stock market is unreliable and crypto is a scam? Well,
        that's perfectly fine, but you can still save money.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "Savings in the bank that earn 0% interest might actually generate an extraordinary return
        if they give you the flexibility to take a job with a lower salary but more purpose, or wait
        for investment opportunities that come when those without flexibility turn desperate."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Once again, it circles back to
        <b>freedom and flexibility.</b>
        Control over your time and options is invaluable.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Reasonable Rational</h2>
      <blockquote>
        "You're not a spreadsheet. You're a person. A screwed-up, emotional person."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        One common mistake is to consider wealth and finance a
        <b>hard science,</b>
        with laws and rules that can be universally applied, complete with strict prediction models
        and formulas.
      </p>

      <em>Well, it's not.</em>

      <p>
        Again, we tend to forget about feelings and the human element. It's better to be
        <b class="text-green-500">mostly reasonable</b>
        than
        <b class="text-blue-500">coldly rational.</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        Basically, don't assume that this year's annual return will be 10% just because of
        historical precedents and models. It's nice to rely on
        <b>investment forecasts,</b>
        but don't forget that they are just that‚Äîforecasts.
      </p>

      <blockquote>"Imagine how much harder physics would be if electrons had feelings."</blockquote>

      <h2>12. Surprise üéÅ</h2>

      <p>
        Again, we often use history as a guide to predict the future. However, it's a little ironic
        because surprises happen all the time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Imagine living after
        <b>WW1;</b>
        would you ever have thought that an even larger and deadlier conflict could occur? Now,
        that's an extreme example, but it's a powerful one.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Fukushima nuclear reactor in Japan was designed to withstand any natural disaster based
        on past experience. However, it still failed.
      </p>

      <em>Do you see the point here?</em>

      <p>
        While it's good to take historic events as reference, you must always prepare for the worst.
      </p>

      <b>You might be underestimating me.</b>

      <p>Do you have a backup plan? Well, have two more ü´°</p>

      <blockquote>
        "The thing that makes tail events easy to underappreciate is how easy it is to underestimate
        how things compound. For example, 9/11 prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates,
        which helped drive the housing bubble, leading to the financial crisis, a poor job market,
        and tens of millions seeking a college education, resulting in $1.6 trillion in student
        loans with a 10.8% default rate. It's not intuitive to link 19 hijackers to the current
        weight of student loans, but that's what happens in a world driven by a few outlier tail
        events.‚Äù
