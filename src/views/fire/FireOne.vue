      <p>
        Have you ever heard about
        <b class="text-indigo">FIRE</b>
        and the
        <b class="text-indigo">4%</b>
        rule?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, if you're in the tech bubble, you probably have. But for those unfamiliar, FIRE
        essentially stands for
        <em>“Financial Independence, Retire Early”</em>
        . As for the 4% rule, let me quote from
        <a class="text-indigo" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/four-percent-rule.asp">
          Investopedia:
        </a>
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The 4% Rule suggests the ideal amount a retiree should withdraw from retirement savings
          annually.
          <br />
          It aims to provide a steady and safe income stream to meet both current and future
          financial needs of a retiree.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        <b>TL;DR:</b>
        Essentially, how can I retire as early as possible and how much money will I need?
      </p>

      <p>
        Diving into the details, you'll encounter a variety of opinions, including some that declare
        the 4% rule
        <em>“dead”</em>
        💀 However, the fundamental goal remains the same: to retire as early as possible.
      </p>

      <em>Okay, Lucian - what's all this about? What's your angle?</em>

      <p>
        At the heart of FIRE is the idea to understand oneself and set clear goals. If you're an
        overthinker and planner like me, you're bound to have numerous questions and doubts, such
        as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>At what age do I want to retire?</li>
        <li>Which country should I settle in?</li>
        <li>How many children do I plan to have?</li>
        <li>Is a Porsche really necessary for my mid-life crisis?</li>
        <li>What kind of lifestyle am I aiming for?</li>
        <li>etc...</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Hence, this blog post. It marks the beginning of a series on FIRE, where my first step is to
        understand my own goals and document the journey in a digital diary.
      </p>

      <h2>🧑🏻‍💻 Current Situation</h2>

      <p>
        Now, before I start, I want to provide a bit of context about my
        <b class="text-indigo">current situation:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I'm 26 (soon to be 27)</li>
        <li>I'm a software engineer</li>
        <li>I have no debt</li>
        <li>I started investing around 2019 (I was 23)</li>
        <li>I live in Romania 🇷🇴</li>
      </ul>

      <em>Now, what about some numbers 👀</em>

      <p>
        I'm not comfortable sharing exact figures at the moment. I think I need to build up the
        courage first with some
        <em>warm-up</em>
        posts. However, I do aim to be as transparent as possible as I continue writing.
      </p>

      <p>
        But as you might infer from the ☝️ points above, I'm in a very favorable position, and I'm
        grateful for it 🙏
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why I'm looking to leverage my position as much as possible; you never know how life
        might unfold. I want to be prepared for the worst.
      </p>

      <h2>🇷🇴 The Fall of Communism in Romania and FIRE</h2>

      <p>
        This mindset of being prepared for the worst and maximizing my position, I believe, comes
        from my father.
      </p>

      <p>
        After communism fell in 1989 in Romania, a period of great opportunities ensued. People were
        starting businesses left and right, securing great deals on land and houses, or finding jobs
        abroad to leverage their earnings for investments back in Romania.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was the
        <b>wild west</b>
        of capitalism, mainly because nobody fully understood what was happening or how capitalism
        worked. But a key aspect was the lack of
        <em class="text-indigo">bureaucracy</em>
        and
        <em class="text-indigo">regulation.</em>
        This, of course, also led to much corruption and shady dealings. But that's a story for
        another time.
      </p>

      <em>
        What's the connection between the fall of communism and FIRE? And what about my father?
      </em>

      <p>
        That period has since ended, and now Romania is more regulated and somewhat stable,
        especially since joining NATO and the EU 🇪🇺
      </p>

      <p>
        My father capitalized on that era and built a decent net worth from cheap real estate he
        acquired in the early 2000s. To give you an idea, back then, you could buy a studio
        apartment in the center of a major city for
        <b>$2,000.</b>
        Now, the same apartment is worth over
        <b>$40,000.</b>
      </p>

      <em>
        That's a 20x increase - and if you know a thing or two about investing - that's significant.
      </em>

      <p>
        His goal was -
        <em>and brace yourself for this</em>
        - to retire at 30.
      </p>

      <p>He's now 51. Did he manage to achieve his goal?</p>

      <p><b>He never reached FIRE status.</b></p>

      <p>I won't go into details, but you're probably wondering how and why not.</p>

      <p>
        Well, I believe he did his best, given his starting point and circumstances, but the issues
        were:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The 2007–2008 financial crisis - he was unprepared for it</li>
        <li>Over-reliance on real estate</li>
        <li>3 children - he was somewhat prepared for this</li>
        <li>His cash flow didn't improve and didn't account for factors like inflation</li>
        <li>He avoided taking risks</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Again, if you have a basic understanding of investing, you'll probably spot a few red flags
        🚩 in the points above ☝️
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not blaming my father; he's a wonderful parent and provided the best for me and my
        siblings.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, his experience has offered me some invaluable lessons about FIRE, lessons that are
        now shaping my goals.
      </p>

      <p>The main lessons are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Fully seize your opportunities</li>
        <li>
          Make the most of your early 20s and 30s,
          <i>especially if you're considering starting a family</i>
        </li>
        <li>Educate yourself about economics and finance</li>
        <li>Diversify your investments and be open to taking calculated risks</li>
        <li>
          Always prepare for unexpected changes, as you never know when the
          <em>golden age</em>
          might end
        </li>
      </ol>

      <em>My goals? Well, they're a work in progress.</em>

      <p>But I'm aiming to have a draft ready by the end of the year 🤝</p>

      <p>For now, I hope my father's story has provided some insight 📚</p>
