      <p>
        This year, I reached an important milestone:
        <b>$100k net worth</b>
        üéâ
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER:</b>
        <em>
          My aim is not to boast. I believe that if I'm going to write about FIRE, investments, and
          money on the internet, I owe it to my readers to be somewhat transparent about my own
          finances.
        </em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, I started from scratch,
        <b>zero external help,</b>
        apart the great education from my parents which I'm very thankful for. In fact, back in 2019
        when I began investing, I had a bank loan for, guess what? A TV and a PlayStation 4 ü§¶üèª
      </p>

      <p>
        As I share my current situation, I'll sprinkle in some tips. Feel free to take them or leave
        them, as everyone's situation is unique.
      </p>

      <h2>Part 1: Where does most of the 100k come from?</h2>

      <p>
        Stocks and crypto have performed quite well in recent months, which definitely contributed.
        However, the bulk of the 100k is not a result of extraordinary investment skills, but rather
        a byproduct of my savings.
      </p>

      <p>
        In your early
        <b>20s</b>
        , the best investment is in yourself, which should yield high returns in the form of a
        higher salary later.
      </p>

      <p><b>‚ÑπÔ∏è TIP #1: Invest in yourself and find a "high return" career</b></p>

      <p>
        In my view, your job income should
        <b>scale</b>
        with your skill and experience. While most jobs do, another critical factor is the market
        demand for your skills.
      </p>

      <p>Here's the breakdown of my net worth so far:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Cash - $31,000 - 30%</li>
        <li class="text-red-500">Crypto - $18,850 - 18%</li>
        <li class="text-yellow-500">Stocks - $35,486 - 35%</li>
        <li class="text-green-500">Bonds - $16,700 - 16%</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For a grand total of:
        <b class="text-indigo">$102,021</b>
      </p>

          ‚ÑπÔ∏è TIP #2: Keep track of everything! My first spreadsheets are back from 2019 when I was
          still 23.

      </p>

      <p>
        ‚ùì
        <b>Possible Question:</b>
        Lucian, do you follow any specific investment strategy?
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>A:</b>
        Not exactly! I don't adhere to strategies like
        <a
          class="text-indigo"
          href="https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/education/model-portfolio-allocation"
        >
          70/30,
        </a>
        but I plan to set specific allocation percentages for each asset class in the coming years.
        So far, I have not done any
        <a class="text-indigo" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rebalancing.asp">
          rebalancing,
        </a>
        but I intend to start soon.
      </p>

      <em>Do I have no investing plan at all?</em>

      <p>
        Not exactly. I have some rules in place, but since I'm still in my first five years of
        investing, I'm constantly learning and refining my strategy.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‚ùì
        <b>Possible Question:</b>
        Why such a large percentage in cash? üëÄ
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>A:</b>
        Real Estate. I'm planning to invest in real estate soon, hence the need for a significant
        amount of liquidity.
      </p>

      <h2>Part 2: Stocks - Allocation and Performance ü´°</h2>

      <p>
        I invest solely in
        <a
          class="text-indigo"
          href="https://www.degiro.ie/knowledge/investing-in-etfs/difference-between-accumulating-etfs-distributing-etfs#:~:text=An%20accumulating%20ETF%20is%20a,value%20of%20the%20ETF%20increases."
        >
          accumulating ETFs.
        </a>
        More specifically, I have a 50/50 split between:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>VWCE</b>
          - Vanguard FTSE All-World Acc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>VUAA</b>
          - Vanguard S&P 500 Acc.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dkcw58wif/image/upload/v1703980082/lucianghimpu.com/fire-5/etf-performance-2023.png"
          alt="ETF performance chart"
        />
        <figcaption>1-Year Performance</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        As you can see, this year they had a
        <b>~19%</b>
        performance, which is quite good.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‚ùì
        <b>Possible Question:</b>
        Why ETFs? Why not individual stocks?
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>A:</b>
        I'm a passive investor, so I prefer effortless investing. I don't want to spend time
        researching individual stocks.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>‚ÑπÔ∏è TIP #3: Optimize for Taxes and Fees.</b>
        I do this firstly by investing in accumulating ETFs (as they don't distribute dividends and
        don't trigger a taxable event), and secondly by optimizing everything related to fees:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Find platforms with reasonable fees*</li>
        <li>Ensure you use favorable exchange rates (e.g. Revolut)</li>
        <li>Opt for bank wires with low or no fees (e.g. Revolut Premium)</li>
      </ol>

      <em>
        *while avoiding platforms with high fees is essential, it's also crucial not to be misled by
        "0 fee" platforms, as they often have other side effects. Overall,
        <a class="text-indigo" href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/home.php">
          Interactive Brokers
        </a>
        is probably the best option.
      </em>

      <h2>Part 3 - Bonds</h2>

      <p>I'll keep this brief: this year, I bought bonds issued by the Romanian Government.</p>
      <p>
        They offer an average
        <b>7.5%</b>
        return rate with a 3-year maturity. So, there's not much more to say here ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‚ùì
        <b>Possible Question:</b>
        Why not a savings account?
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>A:</b>
        Taxes. In Romania, you pay a 10% tax on interest earned in savings accounts. Considering
        that, bonds are a better option.
      </p>

      <p>As you can see, I'm quite particular about taxes and fees üëÄ</p>

      <h2>Part 4 - Crypto ü´†</h2>

      <p>
        Interestingly, crypto was the first "financial instrument" I became interested in. Back in
        2019, I was investing around
        <b>~$20</b>
        per month in crypto.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have
        <b>a lot</b>
        to say about crypto, some good, some bad. I'll delve into that in another post. For now,
        let's focus on the crypto portfolio and its performance.
      </p>

        />
        <figcaption>Crypto Performance</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        As of today, the performance is approximately
        <span class="text-green-500">~35%</span>
        .
      </p>

      <p>
        Crypto is unpredictable; a few months ago, this post might have shown a
        <span class="text-red-500">negative</span>
        trend.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, I'm currently taking profits, so I'm not too worried about future market movements.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>
          ‚ÑπÔ∏è TIP #4: With crypto and other high-risk investments, knowing when to take profits is
          crucial. Avoid greed.
        </b>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>‚ÑπÔ∏è TIP #5: DON'T sell when the market is down and confirm a loss.</b>
        If you do, you probably shouldn't have invested in the first place.
      </p>

      <h2>Part 6: Conclusions üìù</h2>

      <p>To highlight some positives and negatives:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I'm not entirely satisfied with my savings rate. It's around
          <span class="text-red-500">~38%,</span>
          which isn't bad, but there's room for improvement
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="text-red-500">Expenses</span>
          increased this year while income remained the same
        </li>
        <li>
          Almost every month, my net worth
          <span class="text-green-500">increased</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          Year-to-date, all asset classes have shown
          <span class="text-green-500">positive</span>
          performance
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        There's nothing groundbreaking here, just basic
        <b>money saving</b>
        and
        <b>passive investing.</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        It might seem boring ‚Äî YTD, ETF, bonds... but I urge you to start investing. Don't let banks
        profit at your expense or inflation eat away at your savings.
      </p>

      <p>
        I often say to my girlfriend when we discuss
        <b>Capitalism:</b>
      </p>

      <em>
        "I hate the system too, my love, but it's better to understand how it works and benefit from
        it."
      </em>

      <p>
        It might sound selfish and corny, but my point is: if banks and other entities profit from
        you, why don't you profit from them?
      </p>
