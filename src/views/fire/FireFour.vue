      <p>I continued to reflect on my Ikigai.</p>

      <p>
        As I mentioned in the
        <a class="text-indigo" href="/posts/fire-3">previous post,</a>
        to set some FIRE goals, it was essential for me to define my Ikigai, or at least have a
        rough idea of the direction I'm heading in.
      </p>

      <p>
        To this end, I began reading a book about Ikigai. Having finished it, I discovered that the
        second part of the book focuses on
        <em>resilience, stoicism, negative visualization, and similar concepts.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        To provide a bit more
        <b>context,</b>
        the book explores the concept of Ikigai through the lens of üáØüáµ Okinawa, renowned for its
        high population of centenarians.
      </p>

      <p>The core idea is that perhaps longevity is linked to one's Ikigai.</p>

      <p>
        Ultimately, the book culminates with
        <i class="text-indigo">"The ten rules of Ikigai"</i>
        , which I thought would be insightful to reflect upon and share üëÄ
      </p>

      <h2>1. Stay active; don't retire</h2>

      <p>
        Maybe it's just me, but the traditional notion of retirement seems rather boring üíÄ Work for
        40 years, save money, and then just sit around doing nothing? ü§î
      </p>

      <h2>2. Take it slow</h2>

      <p>A quote from the book:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Being in a hurry is inversely proportional to the quality of life.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Oh boy, I definitely need to learn to live more slowly. This is a work in progress ü§ì.</p>

      <p>
        I constantly feel the need to accomplish everything quickly, but why? I'm pretty sure it's
        partly due to technology.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Don't fill your stomach</h2>

      <p>
        The book dedicates a chapter to the Okinawan diet, emphasizing their principle of eating
        until you're 80% full.
      </p>

      <p>
        While I generally see the merit in this rule,
        <span class="text-red-500">I don't fully agree</span>
        with the entire Okinawan diet.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, discussing diet can be as discussing politics - so many opinions and so many
        different truths.
      </p>

      <p><b>For now, I'm sticking to my 2 grams of protein per kg of body weight per day ü´°</b></p>

      <h2>4. Surround yourself with good friends</h2>

      <p>This seems to be a universally acknowledged truth.</p>

      <p>
        I'd extend this to maintaining
        <b>positive social</b>
        connections overall, including family, friends, colleagues, etc...
      </p>

      <p>And most importantly, your significant other ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

      <h2>5. Get in shape for your next birthday</h2>

      <p>Fully agree with this, nothing more to add ü´°</p>

      <h2>6. Smile</h2>

      <p>
        It's quite funny, but back in high school, whenever we had issues with a teacher, our tutor
        and math teacher would say:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Just look at the blackboard and smile</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Fast forward about 10 years, and it's become a core principle of mine. Even when it's
        difficult, maintaining a positive outlook is essential. It will get better.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Reconnect with nature</h2>

      <p>
        This year, I've spent more time in nature than ever before. What could be more relaxing than
        listening to and watching a river stream in nature? üèûÔ∏è
      </p>
      <p><b>I plan to continue spending more time in nature.</b></p>

      <p>
        I can definitely say that one of my FIRE goals is to have a house
        <span class="text-green-500">close to nature</span>
        and
        <span class="text-red-500">away from a big city.</span>
      </p>

      <h2>8. Give thanks</h2>

      <p>
        Over time, I've learned that what we sometimes take for granted or label as
        <i class="text-red-500">"bad experiences/mistakes"</i>
        , often turn out to be
        <span class="text-green-500">positive</span>
        in hindsight, and I end up being thankful for them.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Live in the moment</h2>

      <p>
        As the book puts it:
        <em>"Stop regretting the past and fearing the future."</em>
        üôè
      </p>

      <p>
        I probably struggle more with the latter part, often finding myself overthinking about the
        future.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Follow Your Ikigai</h2>

      <p>Hehe, but what is my Ikigai? I'll leave you with a quote from the book:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          If you don't know what your Ikigai is yet, as Viktor Frankl says, your mission is to
          discover it
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>

      <p>So, did I just copy-paste 10 things from a book?</p>

      <em>Well yes, but actually no.</em>

      <p>
        I know, nothing revolutionary but this was a way for me to reflect through writing. In the
        process, I thought of sharing it.
      </p>

      <h2>BONUS: additional highlights üëÄ</h2>

      <p>I'll leave here some additional highlights I took while reading:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          One thing that everyone with a clearly defined ikigai has in common is that they pursue
          their passion no matter what. They never give up, even when the cards seem stacked against
          them or they face one hurdle after another.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Fall seven times, rise eight.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Nothing wrong with enjoying life's pleasures as long as they do not take control of your
          life as you enjoy them.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          To practice negative visualization, we have to reflect on negative events, but without
          worrying about them [...] knowing what we can control and what we can't,
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The things we love are like the leaves of a tree: They can fall at any moment with a gust
          of wind.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Wabi-sabi teaches us to appreciate the beauty of imperfection as an opportunity for
          growth.
        </p>
