      <p>
        Recently, I applied for various
        <b class="text-indigo">Android Mid-Senior roles</b>
        in Europe and I ended up joining
        <a class="text-indigo" href="https://qonto.com/en">Qonto</a>
        as a Senior Android Engineer üéâ
      </p>

      <p>
        I wanted to share my experience and the resources I used to prepare for the interviews since I know the market is not great for
        developers these days. But a good thing is that it's also
        <b class="text-green-500">not that bad either.</b>
        You will find opportunities. Also, things in Europe üá™üá∫ are a little bit different than in the US üá∫üá∏ where there seems to be a big
        focus on LeetCode-style interviews. Anyway, let's get started üëÄ
      </p>

      <h2>Intro</h2>

      <p>Ok, so first of all, let me give some context about my situation in particular:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I was looking for
          <b>Mid-Senior</b>
          roles as I have about ~6 years of experience.
        </li>
        <li>I was mainly looking in üá™üá∫ Europe and üá∑üá¥ Romania in particular.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Remote only</b>
          (as a contractor).
        </li>
        <li>
          90% Android position, but I also applied and interviewed for generic
          <em>Software Engineer</em>
          positions.
        </li>
        <li>
          I started looking around in
          <b>late December 2023.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          I started applying in
          <b>late January 2024.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          I had the first interviews in
          <b>early February 2024.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          In
          <b>early March,</b>
          I accepted an offer.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Also, a few
        <b class="text-yellow-500">‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMERS:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I will not mention what company X asked, but I'll just give generic tips. I'll also give some tips specific to Romania.</li>
        <li>Although I applied mainly for Android positions, I will first try to give some generic tips that apply to all.</li>
        <li>
          I will not mention the basic stuff such as:
          <em>"write a good CV," "prepare for the interview," "be on time," "ask questions,"</em>
          etc...
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Market üè™</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The market is not that bad. If you have
          <b>a little bit of experience,</b>
          you will for sure find opportunities ‚Äì yes, not as in covid days, but if you ask me, that was for sure an exception.
        </li>
        <li>Entry-level positions seemed harder to find, but again, I was NOT looking for that.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Full remote</b>
          positions are
          <b class="text-red-500">harder</b>
          to find, especially as a
          <b>contractor,</b>
          but as an employee in the company's country, it is easier (e.g., üá∑üá¥ Romania), but still less than before.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some companies post full remote positions on LinkedIn, but then in the interview, they tell you it's either hybrid OR they just
          did it to get more candidates, but the job is in the office ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>To give an idea:</b>
        At one point, I had 4 HR interviews, 2 technical ones, and a home assignment in a week AND
        <b>I had to reject some interviews or postpone them</b>
        because I didn't have time to prepare for all of them ‚Äì I'm not saying this to boast, just to highlight that there is demand.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b class="text-blue-500">TIP #1:</b>
        Don't apply to too many jobs at the same time; you may end up overwhelmed and lose some good opportunities ü´†
      </p>

      <p>The websites I used to find opportunities:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/">LinkedIn</a>
          - 80% from here
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://euremotejobs.com/">EuRemoteJobs</a>
          - 10% from here
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://remoteok.com/">RemoteOk</a>
          - 2.5% from here
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://weworkremotely.com/">WeWorkRemotely</a>
          - 2.5% from here
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://androidjobs.io/">AndroidJobs</a>
          - 2.5% from here
        </li>
        <li>
          And the rest are from other more obscure websites ‚Äì usually if you just Google:
          <em>"remote jobs bla bla bla,"</em>
          you will find them on the first page.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        <b class="text-blue-500">TIP #2:</b>
        I also recommend just looking for companies/products you like to see if they have open opportunities. You will be amazed how many
        companies don't post on job boards.
      </p>

      <h2>The Interviews</h2>

      <p>Okay, so what do they ask? Do I need to grind Leetcode? Did I receive a two-week home assignment?</p>

      <p>It depends - but there are three factors I identified:</p>

      <h3>1. Company Location</h3>

      <p>
        üá∑üá¥ Romanian companies (66%) tend to ask very specific theoretical questions related to the programming language/framework over
        generic Software Engineer concepts.
      </p>

      <p>Basically direct questions from the documentation üìñ A little bit weird if you ask me - but better than in the past.</p>

      <p>
        <b class="text-blue-500">Tip #3:</b>
        <em>(Romania-only)</em>
        Make sure to have robust knowledge of the language and framework you are applying for first.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other hand, üá™üá∫ European Companies are definitely more focused on generic Software Engineer concepts: OOP, Design Patterns,
        clean code, etc... Also, they tend to give take-home assignments - but not all of them.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Company Size</h3>

      <p>
        In the past, I did grind Leetcode and I do have a copy of the
        <em>Cracking the Coding Interview</em>
        book
        <em>(that's because I had less experience - see point 3 üëá)</em>
        . But to be honest, I had
        <b>ZERO</b>
        use of them this time. Actually, just one company gave me some take at home
        <a class="text-indigo" href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">Hackerrank</a>
        questions.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dkcw58wif/image/upload/v1712331912/lucianghimpu.com/android-interview/ctci.jpg"
          alt="Post Image"
        />
        <figcaption>My battle-tested copy</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        That being said, I'm sure that if you aim for
        <b>FAANG,</b>
        you will for sure have a round if not more of algo and data structures. And even if you don't, it's still a big advantage to be very
        confident in your algorithm and data structure knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        For most
        <b>Mid-Large</b>
        Startup/Scale-up and non-FANG companies, the interviews usually look like this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>HR Interview</li>
        <li>(Optional) Home assignment</li>
        <li>1-3 Technical Interviews</li>
        <li>Final Interview with Manager</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        <b class="text-blue-500">Tip #4:</b>
        From my experience, companies that give home assignments tend to be more serious and have a better hiring process.
        <b>I would focus on these companies first.</b>
      </p>

      <h3>3. Experience</h3>

      <p>This is a little bit more obvious:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b class="text-green-500">Entry level:</b>
          More algorithms, data structures - Leetcode style, sometimes in the language specific (e.g., for C# - some LINQ), OOP, and clean
          code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="text-yellow-500">Mid-level:</b>
          Clean code, OOP, Design Patterns, concurrency, framework/language specific questions, and MAYBE some system design.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="text-red-500">Senior:</b>
          More focus on System Design, architecture, clean code, OOP, Design Patterns, concurrency, and then framework/language specific
          questions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>And to share from my actual experience:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b class="text-blue-500">Tip #5:</b>
          Be super prepared for
          <b>concurrency</b>
          questions; I was asked in
          <b>90%</b>
          of the interviews.
        </li>
        <li>
          Most ask about OOP, SOLID, abstraction
          <b>(85%)</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          Testing is also a very frequent topic
          <b>(80%)</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control - related to Clean Architecture but I wanted to mention it as it's more commonly
          asked in Android interviews
          <b>(80%)</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          A good chunk ask about Clean Architecture
          <b>(60%)</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          Few ask about Modularization, working in a big team/project and how to deal with that
          <b>(33%)</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          I was
          <b>never</b>
          asked about
          <b>Design Patterns</b>
          BUT personally I would still recap them as you can stumble across them very easily while talking about other concepts.
        </li>
        <li>
          And of course
          <b>100%</b>
          in a way or another ask about language and framework specific
          <em>
            (I'll cover
            <span class="text-green-500">Android</span>
            ones later)
          </em>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è [Important] Behavioral Questions</h2>

      <p>
        So far, I've just covered the technical aspect, but I think Soft Skills are more important. And I don't mean just passing the HR
        interviews; the entire process challenges your soft skills:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Writing skills:</b>
          from your CV, to email replies, to documentation you have to write in your home assignments
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Communication Skills:</b>
          pretty much in the entire process
        </li>
        <li>
          Then you will 100% be asked about:
          <b>teamwork, &nbsp;</b>
          <b>conflict resolution, &nbsp;</b>
          <b>feedback, &nbsp;</b>
          etc... Not just in the HR interview but also in the technical ones.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        <b class="text-blue-500">Tip #6:</b>
        Please don't overlook the
        <b>behavioral</b>
        aspect - it is more important than the technical one. You can get away being a little bit weaker technically if you are strong in
        the behavioral aspect. Have a look at:
        <b>Part V. Behavioral Questions</b>
        from the introduction Chapter of
        <b>Cracking the Code Interview</b>
        and the
        <a class="text-indigo" href="https://capd.mit.edu/resources/the-star-method-for-behavioral-interviews/">STAR method.</a>
      </p>

      <h2>Some Resources üìö</h2>

      <p>
        I already mentioned
        <b>Cracking the Code Interview</b>
        a few times, but let me give you a full list of relevant resources:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <a class="text-indigo" href="https://amzn.to/4b0FFTl">Cracking The Code Interview</a>
          - even if you don't aim for US/FAANG companies some information is still relevant.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a class="text-indigo" href="https://amzn.to/4aqhlKG">Clean Code</a>
          - you can find summaries on the internet, a good resource for clean code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a class="text-indigo" href="https://amzn.to/43Llx50">Clean Architecture</a>
          - same as above.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a class="text-indigo" href="https://refactoring.guru/">Refactoring Guru</a>
          - an amazing free resource for Design Patterns and clean code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a class="text-indigo" href="https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer">System Design Primer</a>
          - must-read if you aim for Senior roles. Not so much for frontend/mobile devs but I still find the information useful.
        </li>
        <li>Your language/framework documentation.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Random Tips üîÄ</h2>

      <p>
        Before I jump into the
        <b class="text-green-500">Android</b>
        specific part of the blog post, I just wanted to throw some random tips ü´°
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Try to schedule the interviews at companies you don't like that much first - to "practice" a little bit - especially if it has
          been a long time since you had an interview. I did this, and it helped me a lot to find
          <b class="text-yellow-500">weak spots</b>
          in my knowledge and be more prepared for interviews at companies I really wanted to work for.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do some
          <b>research</b>
          on companies that you really would love working for - usually, the enthusiasm is visible, and being more informed helps.
        </li>
        <li>Be 100% sure you will be asked questions from your CV - so make sure you know everything you wrote there.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>üì± Android Specific</h2>

      <p>The first thing I can say for Android jobs is that I'm very happy about three things:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          No company asked about
          <b>Java</b>
          ü™¶
        </li>
        <li>
          Most codebases nowadays use
          <b>coroutines</b>
          and
          <b>flow</b>
          üôè
        </li>
        <li>
          The majority already started using
          <b>Jetpack Compose</b>
          as well.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        That being said, and as I was mentioning above,
        <b>concurrency</b>
        is a topic you will for sure be asked, so be extra prepared for that. If you never used coroutines, be prepared to talk about what
        you used (e.g. RxJava).
      </p>

      <p>And for the rest, I'll list here various topics I was either asked about OR I think you should be prepared for:</p>

      <h3>Mobile Concepts</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>User Experience</b>
          - have a strong user-oriented mindset.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Device Compatibility</b>
          - version compatibility, screen configuration, localization.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Device Features</b>
          - not as important; if you never worked in an app that uses the camera - I doubt it will be a problem.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Accessibility</b>
          - I was asked about this in some interviews; I wouldn't put it as a must-know, but it's good to have an idea.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Offline</b>
          support
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Kotlin Topics</h3>

      <p>
        As weird as it might sound, give a quick skim over the
        <a class="text-indigo" href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html">Kotlin Documentation.</a>
        Here are some topics I find relevant to recap:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Nullability</b>
          - compared to Java,
          <code>!! ?. ?:</code>
          operators
        </li>
        <li><b>Data Class</b></li>
        <li>
          <b>Casts</b>
          -
          <code>as/as?</code>
          , smart casts
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Code visibility</b>
          - Kotlin's specifics
        </li>
        <li><b>Extensions</b></li>
        <li><b>Delegation</b></li>
        <li><b>Sealed</b></li>
        <li>
          <b>Kotlin's functional aspect</b>
          - trailing lambdas, inline functions, high-order functions
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Scope Functions</b>
          -
          <code>let, run, with, apply, also</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="text-yellow-500">‚ö†Ô∏è Very important:&nbsp;</span>
          <b>Coroutines</b>
          -
          <code>launch, async, withContext, flow</code>
          really anything on the topic.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Sometimes taking notes on paper helps you remember better - I did this while revisiting the Kotlin documentation and other topics.

      <h3>Android Concepts</h3>

      <p>
        Again, just stick to the
        <a class="text-indigo" href="https://developer.android.com/guide">Google Documentation</a>
        and you should be good. Optionally, also their
        <a class="text-indigo" href="https://www.youtube.com/@AndroidDevelopers">YouTube channel</a>
        is an amazing resource. And if you need specific topics:
      </p>

      <h4>Data-wise:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>A serialization library</li>
        <li>
          <b>Retrofit</b>
          and
          <b>OkHttp</b>
          for network
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Room</b>
          for local storage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Also knowledge about
          <b>Preferences</b>
          and other methods of storing data
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Repository</b>
          and
          <b>Mediator</b>
          patterns.m
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Architecture-wise:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>MVVM</b>
          seems to be the most common nowadays, but really just having in mind an architecture to follow
        </li>
        <li><b>Modularization</b></li>
        <li>
          <span class="text-yellow-500">‚ö†Ô∏è Very important:&nbsp;</span>
          <b>Dependency Injection</b>
          -
          <code>Dagger and Hilt</code>
          - benefits, hilt vs dagger, etc...
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Navigation</b>
          - you will be asked questions related to navigation (e.g., how to pass data between fragments)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Frameworks-wise</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Lifecycle</b></li>
        <li>
          <span class="text-yellow-500">‚ö†Ô∏è Very important:&nbsp;</span>
          <b>Configuration Changes</b>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>
        <span class="text-yellow-500">‚ö†Ô∏è Very important:&nbsp;</span>
        Testing and CI/CD
      </h4>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Unit Testing</b>
          - I don't think you need to know a specific library but be 100% sure you will be asked about what and how you test.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>UI Testing</b>
          - not as common
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>CI/CD</b>
          - you will always be asked about your experience with CI/CD, so make sure you know a thing or two about it.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        And what about the
        <b>UI?</b>
        I don't think it is very common to be asked about UI concepts - as in you will never be asked about the
        <code>LinearLayout</code>
        or
        <code>.padding()</code>
        modifier.
      </p>

      <p>
        The only thing I would say is maybe
        <b>RecyclerView?</b>
        I think this is the only UI element I was ever asked about OR I mentioned it somehow.
      </p>

      <h2>TL;DR:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The market is not as bad as it seems</li>
        <li>Remote jobs are less frequent</li>
        <li>
          Companies in Romania tend to ask more theoretical specific questions
          <i>(I would avoid companies that do so)</i>
        </li>
        <li>European companies are more focused on generic Software Engineer concepts</li>
        <li>Concurrency is a very common topic</li>
        <li>Soft Skills are more important than technical ones</li>
        <li>For Android: Coroutines, Dependency Injection, Clean Architecture, Testing are some of the topics I would focus</li>
      </ul>
