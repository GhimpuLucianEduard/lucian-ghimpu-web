      <p>Time for some concrete goals, don't you think? 🫡</p>

      <p>
        I'm a numbers guy, so this year I decided to have my 2024 goals backed by actual numbers.
        Essentially, I've tried to find concrete metrics to measure my progress throughout the year.
      </p>

      <p>Here's a sneak peek of the end result:</p>

      <p>
        To make things easier, I also plan to
        <span class="text-indigo">track everything</span>
        . It's nothing new, honestly; up to this point, I've regularly tracked financial aspects and
        other matters.
      </p>

      <p>
        In fact, some rows in that table have their own detailed sub-tables to track each entry more
        thoroughly.
      </p>

      <em>By the way, I'm using Notion and Apple Numbers to track most of my stuff 👀</em>

      <p>
        Of course, there are also additional
        <em>"subgoals"</em>
        which aren't tracked. But I'll try to keep them in mind.
      </p>

      <h2>💸 Finance</h2>

      <p>
        I'll start with the easiest category to track, as it's straightforward to find relevant
        metrics, and I already have them from previous years.
      </p>

      <div class="grid grid-cols-2">
        <div>
          <h3>💰 Net Worth & Savings</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>33% net worth increase</li>
            <li>40-45% saving rate</li>
            <li>Increase income ⁉️</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>📈 Investments</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Continue investing in ETFs</li>
            <li>DCA/Sell crypto</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Basically, it's about
        <b>increasing</b>
        net worth/income 📈 and
        <b>decreasing</b>
        📉 expenses.
      </p>

      <p>
        ℹ️ I'll likely write a dedicated end-of-year financial report where I'll delve into more
        details.
      </p>

      <p>
        ⚠️ A special note here: taxes in 🇷🇴 Romania are expected to increase from
        <b class="text-indigo">~4%</b>
        to
        <b class="text-indigo">~18%.</b>
        Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining as it was a very low tax rate, but it will impact my
        finances.
      </p>

      <h2>📝 Reading, Writing & Learning</h2>

      <div class="grid grid-cols-2">
        <div>
          <h3>📚 Books & Learning</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Read 6 books</li>
            <li>3 fiction, 3 non-fiction</li>
            <li>Enroll in 2 courses</li>
            <li>One coding-related, one not</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>✍️ Writing</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Write 1 blog post per week</li>
            <li>Write 2 novels/essays</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        This year, I think I'll focus more on
        <b class="text-indigo">writing,</b>
        and I'm starting to think that taking a course to improve my skills might be a good idea.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Random fact:</b>
        One of my end goals is to write a book
        <em>(not this year).</em>
        I'm still not sure about the topic, but the main idea is a Sci-fi book, so maybe I can try a
        short novel this year.
      </p>

      <h2>⚽️ Sport Goals</h2>

      <p>
        Here's something interesting: I've recently started practicing
        <b class="text-indigo">BJJ</b>
        and I absolutely love it!
      </p>

      <em>BUT, there is a catch...</em>

      <p>
        I used to be a regular gym-goer, training about 5-6 times a week. It's an activity I still
        immensely enjoy.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, with BJJ, I find it impossible to commit 100% to both. Doing at least 3 BJJ
        trainings and 6 gym sessions a week is just too much.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, my
        <b class="text-indigo">compromise</b>
        is to do 3 BJJ sessions and 3 gym sessions per week 🤝, allowing my body to recover.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's the
        <b class="text-indigo">plan</b>
        directly from my Notion:
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dkcw58wif/image/upload/v1703184480/lucianghimpu.com/blog-generic/sport-2024.png"
          alt="Notion page with sport goals"
        />
        <figcaption>Notion page with sport goals</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>My approach here differs for three reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adapting to practicing both activities simultaneously</li>
        <li>Potential injuries</li>
        <li>Time off for extra recovery, holidays, etc...</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We'll see how it goes. I think this category will be the most
        <b class="text-indigo">dynamic</b>
        in terms of goal adjustments as I adapt to the situation.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Later Edit:</b>
        As of 21.12.2023, I've sustained a minor injury in my rib muscles, so I have to take it easy
        for a couple of weeks 💀
      </p>

      <h2>🚂 Travel & Hobbies</h2>

      <div class="grid grid-cols-2">
        <div>
          <h3>🌍 Travel</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Visit 2 countries</li>
            <li>Complete at least 10 mountain trails</li>
            <li>At least 2 camping trips</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>🧸 Hobbies/General</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Build a high-level EDH deck</li>
            <li>Reduce Netflix/streaming usage</li>
            <li>Reattempt game development</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        For me, the highlight is the
        <em>game development</em>
        part. I'd love to give it another go, but I'm unsure about finding the time. It's a perfect
        blend of coding, writing, and creativity.
      </p>

      <h2>To Wrap It Up</h2>

      <p>
        Well, there's nothing crazy here, but you know, in life, not only money has a
        <b class="text-indigo">compound interest</b>
        effect, but also your skills and experiences.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any small incremental progress you make in one year can have a huge impact on your life.
      </p>

      <p>Let's see how things go in maybe 3 months? I'll try then to share an update 🫡</p>
