      <p>Am I the only one who struggles to find the right all-in-one note-taking app?</p>

      <p>
        Ok, so hear me out, for years I've been trying out different solutions for note-taking and
        data tracking.
      </p>

      <em>
        Evernote, OneNote, Notion, Apple Notes, Obsidian, Google Sheets, Apple Numbers, etc...
      </em>

      <p>
        And for me, it was always the case that I needed more than one solution to handle all my use
        cases. So, what are my needs?
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Proper Note Taking</b>
          - that could be general knowledge management, something that I'm learning, a tech project
          I'm documenting üìù
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Productivity Tool</b>
          - sort of like a project management tool, but not as heavy as Jira or Trello.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Data Tracking</b>
          - mainly finances, goals, gym progress, calories, and similar scenarios
          <i>(I'm a numbers guy)</i>
          üìà
        </li>
        <li>Random quick notes ‚ö°Ô∏è</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        So, technically speaking, I need a mix of a rich text editor and spreadsheets. So, just use
        <b>Docs</b>
        for text and
        <b>Sheets</b>
        for data, right?
      </p>

      <p>
        Hold on, because there are some more specific requirements you have to take into account,
        some more important, some less, from my experience you end up compromising on the lower
        priority ones.
      </p>

      <p class="text-red-500 font-bold">High Priority</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Device Sync</b>
          - this is by far the most important feature for me - that's also why I'm a big fan of the
          Apple/Google ecosystems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Super-Rich Text Editor</b>
          - I want to be able to write and format my notes as I want, add code snippets, diagrams,
          and even Kanban boards.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Share and Collaborate</b>
          - for instance, my girlfriend üíÖ and I use
          <b>Notion</b>
          to plan our travel adventures.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-yellow-500 font-bold">Medium Priority</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Offline Support</b>
          - not a must, as usually just 3-4 times a year I'm in a place with bad internet - but it
          does happen, especially when traveling or hiking.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Non-proprietary Format</b>
          - in a nutshell, I want to be able to export my data and move it to another tool if I want
          to (e.g., Notion is not great at this, but Obsidian is since it's all markdown).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>3rd Party Extensions</b>
          - basically, I want to be able to extend the functionality of the tool with plugins and
          API usage.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-green-500 font-bold">Low Priority</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>AI Support</b>
          - well, this is new; most tools are starting to implement this, not a must for now.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Open Source</b>
          - as a developer, it's always nice to have the possibility to contribute to the tool.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Drawing</b>
          - I like to doodle in my notes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Decent Mobile App</b>
          - not WebViews, please ü´†
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Built-in spell check.</b>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Notion</h3>

      <p>
        Right now, I use
        <a class="text-indigo underline font-bold" href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a>
        for 3 main tasks:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Projects</b>
          - to store documentation, kanban boards, and other project-related stuff.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Planning</b>
          - that could be weekly planning, travel planning, goals planning, etc.
        </li>
        <li>Any other heavy writing activities</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        So Notion is
        <b>very flexible,</b>
        not just for note-taking but it's more of a
        <b>productivity tool</b>
        that offers a lot of
        <span class="text-green-500">flexibility.</span>
        But you see, that's the problem; it's not great at any of the main tasks I need it for, but
        it's good enough.
      </p>

      <h3>Obsidian</h3>

      <p>
        Lately, I have been fascinated by
        <a class="text-indigo font-bold underline" href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian,</a>
        a
        <em>markdown</em>
        based writing app that also offers some productivity features. It isn't as complete as
        Notion, BUT I wanted to give it a try.
      </p>

      <p>
        My plan was to try moving to Obsidian, but I started with a small experiment: tracking my
        Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu training sessions, just to get a feel for using it.
      </p>

      <p>So here's an example of such a page:</p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dkcw58wif/image/upload/v1710770583/lucianghimpu.com/notes-and-tracking-1/bjj.png"
          alt="Bjj training document"
        />
        <figcaption>A training session document</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Obsidian also generates a
        <em>knowledge graph</em>
        based on the links between the notes, which is a cool feature, but I'm not sure how useful
        it is for me.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dkcw58wif/image/upload/v1710770582/lucianghimpu.com/notes-and-tracking-1/graph.png"
          alt="Knowledge Graph"
        />
        <figcaption>My small graph</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        So the experiment was successful, BUT when I tried to migrate some of my more
        <b>data-heavy</b>
        documents from Notion to Obsidian, I realized that it's not the best tool for that. It
        struggles with tables and other data-related components.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>I'm 90% sure I'll stop using Obsidian</b>
        - it's cool, but the best use case I see for it is for someone who needs it for studying
        since navigation between linked pages is very easy.
      </p>

      <h3>Old School Handwritten Notes</h3>

      <p>
        I always have a piece of paper near me to write a quick doodle, draw a diagram, or take a
        random note, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        Last month, I also started interviewing a lot for a new job, so I had to study and recap a
        little bit. For me, the best tool for this is an old-school notebook.
      </p>

          alt="Notebook"
        />
        <figcaption>My very bad handwriting</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        I'm using an A5 grid-based
        <b class="text-indigo font-bold">Leuchtturm1917</b>
        notebook. I do have quite bad handwriting; the grid helps me a lot to keep it clean. I love
        it; it's very therapeutic to write on paper. I learn better and remember more effectively.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm
        <b>100%</b>
        sure I'll always keep it on my desk.
      </p>

      <h3>Apple Notes</h3>

      <p>
        Last but not least,
        <b class="text-indigo">Apple Notes</b>
        ü´° - truth be told, I use most of the Apple productivity software (Pages, Numbers, Keynote,
        Freeform). I would say that I use Apple Notes for quick notes, like a shopping list, but
        also for random digital doodles.
      </p>

      <p>I try to use tags and folders, but I'm not very strict. Overall, I'm happy with it.</p>

      <figure>
        <img

      <h2>Data Tracking üìä</h2>

      <p>
        I'm the type of guy who likes to track every aspect of his life. I have this weird dream of
        myself at 80 years old, looking at my data like the
        <em>"statistics"</em>
        screen in Minecraft.
      </p>

      <p>I've divided the data tracking activities into two groups:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Finance Related</b>
          - net worth tracking, expenses, investments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Activity/Hobby Specific</b>
          - gym, calorie intake, MTG collection, LEGO collection, etc.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Finance Tracking</h3>

      <p>
        With this, I have been the most consistent and rigorous, using only
        <b class="text-indigo">Apple Numbers</b>
        for everything, and that's been the case for the last 4 years.
      </p>

      <em>Why Apple Numbers and not Google Sheets or other more powerful solutions?</em>

      <p>
        <b>For one reason:</b>
        Apple Numbers is not one big grid, but a blank page where you can create tables as you need
        - it's just a UI preference.
      </p>

      <p>
        I do acknowledge that it is more limited compared to Google Sheets - in fact, I'm starting
        to consider switching to Google Sheets for a bit of automation. Right now, I'm updating
        manually most of my data (using formulas at least).
      </p>

      <p>
        ‚ÑπÔ∏è Special Note: I also use
        <a class="text-indigo underline font-bold" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">
          CoinMarketCap
        </a>
        to track my crypto portfolio.
      </p>

      <h3>Activity/Hobby Tracking</h3>

      <p>Here I use app/website-specific solutions. I'll list some of them:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Gym Tracking:&nbsp;</b>
          <a class="text-indigo underline font-bold" href="https://www.strong.app/">Strong</a>
          - in the past, I used Apple Notes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Calories:&nbsp;</b>
          <a class="text-indigo underline font-bold" href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/">
            MyFitnessPal
          </a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>MTG Collection:&nbsp;</b>
          <a class="text-indigo underline font-bold" href="https://mtgcollectionbuilder.com/">
            MTG Collection Builder
          </a>
          - the UI is not the best, but it's the most complete one I've found.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Lego Collection:&nbsp;</b>
          <a class="text-indigo underline font-bold" href="https://www.brickeconomy.com/">
            BrickEconomy
          </a>
          - I just love this website; it's so well done.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        You know, in an ideal world, I would love to use a single tool for everything. I know it's
        hard to achieve. I'm also a bit too picky and want a lot of features ü´†
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>My main conclusion</b>
        is that as of right now, you have to use multiple tools to have a complete experience.
      </p>

      <p class="text-green-500 font-bold">I'm very happy with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A
          <b>paper notebook</b>
          for its versatility and therapeutic effect.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Apple Notes</b>
          for my go-to mobile solution.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Hobby/Activity</b>
          specific apps/tools such as BrickEconomy, MyFitnessPal, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-yellow-500 font-bold">I'm somewhat happy with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Notion</b>
          - it's good enough for now; I just hope it gets long-term support.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Apple Numbers</b>
          - I'm starting to feel its limitations; I'll have a look at
          <b>Google Sheets</b>
          soon.
