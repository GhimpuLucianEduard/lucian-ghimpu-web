      <p>
        Ok, so right now probably all companies are doing their mid-year updates, all-hands, OKR reviews, etc. So I thought this would be
        the perfect moment to also do a
        <b>review</b>
        of my goals progress in the past half year.
      </p>

      <p>
        ℹ️ For context, I set some goals ~6 months ago
        <a class="underline text-indigo" href="/posts/personal-goals-2024">here,</a>
        and I tried to also find some metrics to measure my progress.
      </p>

      <p>Fast forward to today, let's see how I did 👀</p>

      <h2>The Overall Picture</h2>

      <figure>

        />
        <figcaption>Overview of the main goals</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Well, the overall progress is at about
        <span class="text-orange-500">~45%</span>
        of the expected progress. So I'm a bit behind, not by a LOT, but still behind.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          I made good progress in
          <span class="text-green-500 font-bold">Finances</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm somewhat on track in
          <span class="text-yellow-500 font-bold">Fitness</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          But lagging behind in
          <span class="text-red-500 font-bold">Self Development and Creativity</span>
          🥲
        </li>
        <li>The rest of the goals are on track</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We will go into more detail for each category and moreover, I'll also
        <span class="font-bold text-indigo">recalibrate</span>
        some of the goals and drop some of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is the first time I actually try to measure all my yearly goals with numbers, so I did expect to overestimate/underestimate
        some of them.
      </p>

      <em>Now let's dive into each category 🏊‍️</em>

      <h2>🏋️ Fitness</h2>

      <p>
        I'm not gonna lie, I’m facing some challenges in this area. It's not that easy to balance both
        <span class="font-bold text-indigo">Weightlifting</span>
        and
        <span class="font-bold text-indigo">Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.</span>
        The hardest part for me is
        <span class="text-blue-500 text-indigo">recovery.</span>
        I think I need to step up my recovery game. I'm not yet sure how, but I'll put some thought into it.
      </p>

      <p>Some key moments so far:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          At the beginning of the year, I got a nasty
          <span class="text-red-500 font-bold">rib injury.</span>
          I think the cause was my core not being strong enough yet for BJJ. That affected my BJJ practice for a couple of weeks.
        </li>
        <li>
          I got
          <span class="font-bold text-indigo">my first stripe</span>
          at BJJ 🎉
        </li>
        <li>
          I tap less often; before, it was kinda common for me to tap 3-5 times in a sparring round with someone with some experience. Right
          now, I can hold my ground for the full round without tapping!
        </li>
        <li>I TAPPED SOMEONE - sometimes I still can’t believe when I submit someone 🫠</li>
        <li>
          And right now, I'm dealing with a
          <span class="text-yellow-500 font-bold">mild trap injury...</span>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As you can see, all the key moments are related to BJJ, and not so much to weightlifting. And to be honest, I enjoy BJJ more. Taking
        this into account, for the next half of the year, I decided to:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <span class="text-green-500">Increase</span>
          priority and effort into BJJ
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="text-red-500">Decrease</span>
          my effort into weightlifting
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="text-blue-500">Improve</span>
          my recovery game
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>🧠 Self Development & 🎨 Creativity</h2>

      <p>
        This is not going very well. I think it's my fault because I've underestimated how hard it is to write some actual good content or
        significant content for me at least.
      </p>

      <p>
        I set a goal to write
        <span class="text-indigo font-bold">1 blog post per week.</span>
        So far, taking into account this post, I wrote 10 posts out of 52. So I decided to reduce this goal to
        <span class="text-yellow-500 font-bold">1.5 posts per month.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        Reading-wise, I've started reading the
        <b>Foundation</b>
        series which I really enjoy! But I want to read some non-fiction books as well.
      </p>

      <h2>💸 Finances</h2>

      <p>On the bright side, I'm doing well in this area. And funny enough, I've not put that much effort into it.</p>

      <p>There are some key things to mention related to this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I was
          <span class="text-red-500 font-bold">laid off</span>
          in the first quarter of the year. This disrupted my cash flow a little bit during that period.
        </li>
        <li>
          I changed companies which also resulted in a
          <span class="text-green-500 font-bold">salary increase</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          The stock market is doing quite well lately and
          <span class="text-indigo font-bold">~40%</span>
          of my net worth is in ETFs
        </li>
        <li>I've started putting more effort into improving my saving rate</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Since I'm pretty sure I'm on track to achieve the
        <span class="text-indigo font-bold">33%</span>
        net worth increase, I'm updating it to
        <span class="text-indigo font-bold">40%</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        One aspect I want to improve is to start investing
        <em class="font-semibold">potentially</em>
        in
        <span class="text-indigo font-bold">real estate.</span>
        And in general, to start learning more about this area. I'm not the biggest fan of real estate, but I think it's worth putting some
        time into it.
      </p>

      <h2>🚂 Travel & 🧸 Hobby</h2>

      <p>Last but not least, I'm on track with these goals. So far this year I have:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Visited Tenerife 🏝 and
          <span class="text-indigo font-bold">fell in love</span>
          with it
        </li>
        <li>
          Had the opportunity to spend some days in
          <span class="font-bold">🇪🇸 Barcelona</span>
          which was amazing
        </li>
        <li>
          And already planning the next trips to
          <span class="font-bold">🇮🇹 Italy</span>
          and
          <span class="font-bold">🇬🇷 Greece</span>
        </li>
        <li>Did plenty of hiking</li>
      </ul>

        />

      <h2>Any new goals?</h2>

      <p>I don't think so. I think I have enough on my plate right now. I'll try to focus on the current goals and achieve them.</p>

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>

      <p>
        As
        <span class="font-bold">Dyatlov</span>
        would say:
        <em>not great, not terrible</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        What I'm sure of is that actually keeping track of them and measuring them is a good idea. Otherwise, I'm 100% sure I would have not
        made the same progress. Let's see how the next half of the year goes 🔜
