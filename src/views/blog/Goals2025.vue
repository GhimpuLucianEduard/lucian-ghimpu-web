      <p>
        <b>TL;DR:</b> One year ago I decided to track my life using actual metrics.
        And now it's time to see how it went and set new goals for 2025 🚀
      </p>

      <h2>2024 Recap</h2>

      <p>
        Last year I create a notion database to track my goals and progress. I've set goals in
        various categories, such as finance, reading, writing, and sports. You can see last year's post <a
        class="text-indigo" href="/posts/personal-goals-2024">
        here</a>
      </p>

      <p>Anyway, this was the database at the beginning of the year:</p>

          :plugins="cloudinary.plugins"
        />

      <p>Later on, in the middle of the year I had review of said goals and adjusted them. You can read more about it <a
        class="text-indigo" href="/posts/personal-goals-2024-mid-year-update">
        here</a>
      </p>

        />

      <p>Finally we reached the end of the year at here's the final look:</p>

        />

      <p>Not great, not terrible. Some categories were a success, while for other I definitely need to improve. Overall
        the situations is
        the following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b><span class="text-green-500"><b></b>Finance</span></b> - great success:
          <ul>
            <li>Net worth increased by <b><span class="text-green-500"><b></b>51%</span></b> - the target was 33%</li>
            <li>Saving rate of <b><span class="text-green-500"><b></b>44%</span></b> ✅</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b><span class="text-blue-500"><b></b>Sport</span></b> - not bad:
          <ul>
            <li>I've managed to have an average of <b><span class="text-blue-500"><b></b>~4-5</span></b> days of
              activity between BJJ and weightlifting
            </li>
            <li>I'm quite happy that I did not quit BJJ as in the beginning it was brutal physically 😭</li>
            <li>I actually earned <b>two</b> white belt stripes in BJJ 🙏 <i>(I'm still bad at it tho)</i></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b><span class="text-amber-500"><b></b>Travel</span></b> - had lot of fun:
          <ul>
            <li>Managed to visit <b><span class="text-amber-500"><b></b>3</span></b> countries</li>
            <li>The highlight must be <b>Tenerife</b> which both me and my significant other fell in love with</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I did not go camping much - most of my camping experience this year was limited watching
              <a class="text-indigo underline" href="https://www.youtube.com/@OutdoorBoys">The Outdoor Boys on
                YouTube</a> 🏕️
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b><span class="text-red-500"><b></b>Self Development</span></b> (reading, writing & personal projects) -
          quite bad:
          <ul>
            <li>Only <b><span class="text-red-500"><b></b>4</span></b> books</li>
            <li><b><span class="text-red-500"><b></b>12</span></b> blog posts with an original plan for <b>52</b> 👀</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2024 Takeaways</h3>

      <p>Given that it was the first time actually tracking with some numbers I'm overall ok with the outcome.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>I <b>overestimated</b> my creativity as 52 posts (1 per week) from writing one once a few months was
          definitely a mistake.
        </li>
        <li>I slacked in the last <b>3 months</b> of the year because I got hooked to some video games 🤡</li>
        <li>I need to review the goals more frequently because I find it quite motivating to see the progress</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>2025 🎯</h2>

      <p>So, what's the plan for 2025?</p>

      <em>To be honest, more or less the same.</em>

      <p>If I learned something from BJJ and investing is that <b>consistency</b> is the key. Of course I did some minor
        adjustments, removed some goals, added others, by I think the key is to just keep doing it.</p>

      <p>Let's have a quick look 👀 at them:</p>

      <figure>
        <AdvancedImage
          :cld-img="cloudinary.createImageInstance('/lucianghimpu.com/goals-2025/new-goals.png')"
          :plugins="cloudinary.plugins"
        />
        <figcaption>2025 Goals</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>The keyword is <b>leaner</b>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Less goals - for instance I've unified BJJ and Weightlifting into a single goal</li>
        <li>More focused</li>
        <li>More realistic - learned from past mistakes</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tips for your goals</h2>

      <p>Here are some tips that I've learned from this experience:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>📈 <b>Track them</b> - just do it. Unless you're super disciplined you'll forget about them in a few weeks
        </li>
        <li>🕵️ <b>Review them</b> - I've found it quite motivating to see the progress</li>
        <li><b>Adjust them </b> - I think it's ok to "recalibrate" them during the year, your a person not a company
        </li>
        <li><b>Be realistic </b> - just look at how it went with by <b>52</b> posts 🤡</li>
        <li><b>Avoid too much granularity</b> - I've found that too many goals can be overwhelming</li>
      </ul>

      <p>And that's it, once again we'll revisit them in 3 or 6 months and see how it goes. For now I hope I've
        motivated some people to actually track their new year resolutions 🙏</p>
