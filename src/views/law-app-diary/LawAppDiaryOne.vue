      <h2>Ok, so hear me out</h2>

      <p>
        I came up with what I think is a somewhat useful idea. Now, I don't want to spoil the full
        product. Not that I'm afraid someone will steal it, but I kinda like not disclosing it,
        makes me feel like I'm working on something big
        <i>(it's not).</i>
        I'll give some details though:
      </p>

      <em>It's related to law and law firms üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è</em>

      <p>
        So my end goal is quite
        <b>BIG</b>
        and I'm not sure I'll be able to pull it off. BUT I'm going to build a mobile app first to
        <em>test the waters</em>
        üëÄ
      </p>

      <p>
        What I mean by that? I'll use this mobile app as a sort of
        <b>MVP</b>
        and validator.
      </p>

      <h2>My background</h2>

      <p>
        My experience as a founder:
        <b class="text-yellow-500">Zero</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience in business:
        <b class="text-orange-500">Zero</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience in law:
        <b class="text-red-500">ZERO</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        My willingness to try and fail:
        <b class="text-green-500">100%</b>
      </p>

      <h2>The Tech Part</h2>

      <p>Ok, so here I actually have some words.</p>

      <h3>The backend (the core of the product)</h3>

      <p>
        First, I actually built a working
        <b>POC</b>
        in Python üêç. And, from my point of view, it was a success!
      </p>

      <p>
        That being said, I realized that as fast as it was to build it in Python, it was as hard to
        scale and maintain.
      </p>

      <em>Why?</em>

      <p>
        Firstly, it's my lack of production-level experience with Python. But mainly, I wanted a
        more `Enterprise` level framework. So I switched to
        <b class="text-green-500">ASP .NET Core.</b>
      </p>

      <p>And oh, how much I love it:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It has a ton of built-in features</li>
        <li>Rider as an IDE is amazing</li>
        <li>Huge community and resources</li>
        <li>And I do have experience with it; I like working with it</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A big dilemma I have is related to the data part, the database -> TBD.</p>

      <h3>The frontend</h3>

      <p>
        Well, as I said, for now, I'll probably validate the backend with a mobile app. And I'm so
        tempted to try React - Expo. I might do a quick MVP with it, just to get "the feel".
      </p>

      <p>Long term, the product will 100% be web-based, but that's for another time.</p>

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>

      <p>
        A startup related to law? That you cannot give details about? That is supposed to be
        web-based but you are building a mobile app first?
      </p>

      <p>Yeah, not a great pitch ü´†</p>

      <p>
        I don't even have a name for it. But my motivation is quite high right now, that ought to be
        enough for me.
