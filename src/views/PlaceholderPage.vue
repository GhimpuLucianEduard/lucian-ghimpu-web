      <h2>👀 Where Did My Motivation Go?</h2>

      <p>
        Over the past months, I've hit several roadblocks trying to kick off, maintain, or wrap up
        personal projects. Whether it's diving into a new tech topic, experimenting with a mini-app,
        or crafting a fully fleshed-out product, the motivation just wasn't there.

        <em>So, the big question - why?</em>

        After some introspection, I pinpointed it to a couple of major culprits:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Overthinking the nitty-gritty (like deciding on the tech stack)</li>
        <li>The ever-elusive motivation slipping away</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Now, the logical step for most would be to dig deeper into the underlying issues, perhaps
        consult some insightful literature or seek advice.
      </p>
      <em>Me? I opted to embark on yet another project 🫡</em>

      <p>This time around, to tackle the aforementioned challenges, I've resolved to:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Ride the wave and not dwell too much on the minutiae ⚡️</li>
        <li>
          Kick off a dev diary, ensuring I stay on track and transparent about my journey –
          <em>hence, this very post</em>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>🔪 Trechery App</h2>
      <p>So you are now probably asking what revolutionary idea you got there Lucian?</p>

      <em>None 👀</em>

      <p>
        I decided to port an existing web app
        <a href="https://mtgtreachery.net/en/">MTG Treachery</a>
        to mobile. In a nutshell 🥜 the app acts as a game lobby for
        <b>Treachery</b>
        with is a
        <b>Magic The Gathering</b>
        format (or game mode).
      </p>

      <em>But why if there's a web version you can still use on your phone?</em>

      <ol>
        <li>The web version is not very stable + nobody loves using web on native</li>
        <li>I wanted to explore a mobile app on both platforms</li>
        <li>
          The project
          <b>is not very big</b>
          and doesn't need a big infrastructure
        </li>
      </ol>
